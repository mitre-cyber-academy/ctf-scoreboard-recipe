Git Cookbook
============

This is a cookbook which simply installs git on your platform. It is in its own repo only so that if we ever have to make any changes to this recipe at a later time it will be easy to update across multiple submodules

You will also have to include this cookbook in your run list and include it as a submodule in your project.
