# ctf-scoreboard-recipe cookbook

This is a cookbook that allows for the automated creation of a scoreboard for the MITRE stem CTF. It also sets up syncing of keys between the VPN box and the scoreboard for users to download.

## To Do

* Update recipe to use Berkshelf.
* Update scoreboard to be downloaded from GitHub instead of using a local copy.
* Update to use official cookbooks instead of ours.
